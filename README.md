# Numerical Methods 

This repository was created as a personal study project to explore and implement numerical methods for solving differential equations. The primary aim was to gain hands-on experience with discretization techniques for solving classical partial differential equations (PDEs) such as:

* The **Advection Equation**
* The **Diffusion Equation**
* The **Heat Equation** 

## Project Structure

* `Algorithms/` - Numeric algorithm scripts 
* `Books/` - Reference materials
* `advection_equation.ipynb` - Numerical solution of the advection equation
* `diffusion_equation.ipynb` - Numerical solution of the diffusion equation
* `heat_equation_1D.ipynb` - Finite difference method for 1D heat equation
* `heat_equation_2D.ipynb` - Finite difference method for 2D heat equation

## Status

ðŸš§ **Work in Progress (Inactive)**

This project is currently not being actively developed and remains incomplete. The existing notebooks demonstrate initial attempts and experiments, but more methods and polishing were planned.

## Goals (Unfinished)

* Implement numerical solvers for:

  * Wave equation
  * Laplaceâ€™s equation
  * More advanced PDEs
* Compare different methods (e.g. explicit vs implicit)
* Analyze stability and convergence of schemes
